### Who is wulfovitch?

I am a student of computer science at the [University of Oldenburg][uni-ol] in Germany. I was always interested in all things that are related to computers, so the decision to study computer wasn't too hard. In fact by studying computer science, I learned a lot about computers itself and some of this knowledge I want to share with you on this blog.

If you want to know more about me, follow me on [twitter][twitter]! 

Don't hesitate to contact me via mail, {% include email.html %}, if you have something on your mind.

### About this Site

The engine behind this blog is actually [jekyll][jekyll]. Jekyll is a static site generator, which means no special server logic or databases are needed to run this blog. Every blog entry consists of a single text file, so it is really easy to maintain these with the version control system [git][git]. Only the commenting system of this blog is hosted [elsewhere][disqus]. I write all my posts with the markup language [markdown][daringfireball], which helps me to focus on writing blog entries itself instead of worrying about the actual markup. My text editor of choice is [textmate][macromates] with the brilliant [railscasts textmate theme][railscasts].
